# SongsWeListenedTo.com

Live: http://www.songswelistenedto.com/

This is a small Angular app made for Skratch Bastid and Cosmo Baker's "Songs We Listened To A Lot in 2014" mix. It
needed to be built rather quickly so I decided to just have it consume a hardcoded JSON file for it's song listing 
rather than build a backend.

We'll be reimagining this concept and building something new for the 2015 edition.

The Twitter feed is now empty and some of the songs have been removed from YouTube. MixCloud widget also needs to
be updated.
