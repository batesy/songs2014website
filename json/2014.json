    "description": "You asked me a while back about songs I listened to a lot in 2014... I'm going with 'Underdog' by Sly & The Family Stone. I mean it's just so ILL. The Production sounds like it could've been made this year. And to think that that's the first cut off the first record they released... What a powerful way to introduce yourself to the world. Not to mention that the content is very fitting for the events of this year.",

America is fucked up, but it's what we've got, so the goal should be to make the best of what we have, and to change everything we can without stepping on other people. Just as importantly, we need to appreciate we do have, because the grass isn't always greener. 'America the Beautiful' sums that up perfectly - a simple message by a dope MC who states his case and steps off after 2:29. Producer Jonwayne gives him the perfect beat - it bends your ear and struts along, but doesn't get in the way of the wisdom. To quote the song: 'Okay the streets aren't paved with gold / At least they paved tho... you know?' We're not there yet, and maybe we're not that close, but let's keep making this country a better place while taking time to smell a rose or two along the way.",

    "description": "'Hunt and Peck' describes shitty typing, but it also applies to my ability to read sheet music. I can play well by ear but lack that next degree of technical fluency. So I'm fascinated when classically trained musicians apply the language of music theory to pop, breaking down the atoms of what we simply 'hear'. Owen Pallett has penned great pieces for Slate and Buzzfeed breaking down the melodic techniques in Katy Perry and Gaga songs.<br><br> I would love for dude to explain eactly why SD's 'Circles' gives me the brain pretzels. It's a three-chord descending / ascending riff of detuned 808's and sad piano that feels more like a grunge album cut or something off a NIN record. Even in a year where everyone and their cousin makes melodic Drake / Young Thug 50 BPM rap records, this one is a gloriously tweaked outlier. 'I know you type woozy'. No shit!",

    "description": "Well... according to my iTunes, the song I listened to the most in 2014 was 'Let it Go' from the Frozen soundtrack, which just leads AC/DC's 'Thunderstruck', but that's because those are my kids two favorite songs... I guess the song that's up there in the top 5 is 'Sitya Loss' by Eddy Kenzo. He's a young dancehall guy from Uganda. I found him because of that video of all the little black African kids dancing to the song 'Jambole' in the front yard of their house. It was reposted so many times online but never with attribution or credit to the artist, so I found out who it was and found the original video. From there I found his other work and was really drawn to it. Ever since I found Ska when I was like 12 years old, I've always had an affinity to dancehall and reggae music. I mean, I listened to reggae before that, but the Ska influence felt young and ownable, like it was reggae for us young punks... Anyway, Eddy Kenzo's shit is fresh. I dance around the living room to is, in my underwear, with my kids. That's how we get down at my house. We dance like no one is fucking watching. WHUT?!",

    "description": "This is always such a fun and reflective challenge. There are seemingly infinite songs to choose from. With music in general being such an emotional experience on the whole it is really tough to hone it down to one song based on all the associative parameters; but this one is my choice for 14. I first saw CHVCHES at one of my favourite venues, The Hoxton, in Toronto and was turned onto their music in the live setting. The drink tickets were flowing, (thanks Richard and Adam), the band was tight, the songs were well crafted and the lead singers voice delivered that haunting certain je ne sais quoi that always gets me. So I followed their music loosely from then on and then stumbled upon this Tourist Remix that is now in heavy rotation in the cabin of the MackTruck. In general I’ve been listening to a lot more “complete” songs when listening to music by myself… I run a global DJ contest so I hear quite enough DJ mixes and club music during the work hours to say the least. This has led me on a search for songs that have roominess to them.  Songs that sound great played loud, that tell a story, that built up slowly from a great intro, through an interesting transition, and onto an actual finishing outro. This particular rendition does all of that for me, so there it is.  Who knows where the sonic adventure for 15 will go.",
